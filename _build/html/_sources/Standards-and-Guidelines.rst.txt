Welcome to Runaterra’s Standards and Guidelines page.

Here you’ll find information about the **Do’s** and **Don’ts** when
working on this project. These rules exists to keep the code base and
project history manageable while still allowing contributors to be
productive.

    This document’s intention is to provide maximal guidance while
    providing reasonable restrictions. Nevertheless, common sense should
    always prevail and each individual situations should be handled
    accordingly.

Git and Github
==============

    The following rules and conventions should be followed across all
    Runaterra’s repositories.

Branching model
---------------

Runaterra’s basically uses the `GitFlow`_ branching model (created by
Vincent Driessen) with a couple of additional adjustments.

**Major Feature vs Minor Feature**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each service’s major functionalities are considered **major features**
which are composed of several **minor features** that work together.

    -  Major features are usually accessed by final users or client
       services.
    -  Minor features are usually used within its own service in the
       form of modules or methods.

Lets take as an example the **Accounting** service, some of its features
are:

-  **Processing of TSS files.**
-  **Processing of 606 files.**

In order to provide this functionalities some internal tasks need to be
executed.

-  **Processing of TSS files.**

   -  Upload the file to server
   -  Process the file as TSS
   -  Retrieve desired information
   -  Output result file.

-  **Processing of 606 files.**

   -  Upload the file to server
   -  Process the file as 606
   -  Retrieve desired information
   -  Output result file.

Each of these small tasks correspond to **minor features** in its
service.

Next, some of these minor features are *common* to both processes and
should be treated as such. Therefore a resulting distribution would look
like this:

-  **Common (Major)**

   -  Upload the file to server (minor)
   -  Output result file (minor)

-  **Processing of TSS files (Major)**

   -  Process the file as TSS (minor)
   -  Retrieve desired information (minor)

-  **Processing of 606 files (Major)**

   -  Process the file as 606 (minor)
   -  Retrieve desired information (minor)

**Naming**:
~~~~~~~~~~~

To improve organization branch naming should follow the next standard.

-  ``MAJOR-FEATURE_brief-change-description``

Example:

-  ``TSS-FILE_fixed-error-with-total-invoice-field``
